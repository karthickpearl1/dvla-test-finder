# Business Model Comparison

## Your Model vs. Traditional SaaS

### Your Request-Based Model ✅ BETTER

**How it Works:**
1. User pays once (£19.99) or for period (£49.99/3mo)
2. Creates request with 3 preferences:
   - Specific centres + date ranges
   - OR "Any Location" + date range ⭐
3. Service finds/books slot
4. Request completes
5. Done!

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clear outcome (find a slot)
- ✅ Natural completion point
- ✅ Higher perceived value (£19.99 one-time vs £9.99/month)
- ✅ One centralized service (efficient)
- ✅ Pay for results (3-week guarantee)
- ✅ Lower maintenance (request-based)
- ✅ Better user psychology (solve a problem, not ongoing monitoring)

**Revenue Potential:**
- Year 1: £40K (conservative)
- Year 2: £300K (growth)

### Traditional SaaS ❌ WORSE

**How it Works:**
1. User pays monthly (£9.99/month)
2. Continuous monitoring
3. User stays subscribed
4. High churn

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Subscription fatigue
- ❌ Continuous value delivery required
- ❌ High churn (users cancel after booking)
- ❌ Lower perceived value
- ❌ Each user = separate instance (inefficient)

**Revenue Potential:**
- Year 1: £10K (conservative)
- Year 2: £50K (growth)

| **Value** | Find/book a slot | Continuous monitoring |
| **Completion** | Request fulfilled | Ongoing |
| **Efficiency** | One service, all users | Each user = instance |
| **Maintenance** | Low (request-based) | High (continuous) |
| **Churn** | Natural (request done) | High (cancel anytime) |
| **Revenue** | Higher per user | Lower per user |
| **Guarantee** | 3-week refund | No guarantee |

## You're Right - This is NOT SaaS!

**It's a Concierge Booking Service**

Similar to:
- Fiverr (pay per task)
- TaskRabbit (pay per service)
- Upwork (pay per project)

NOT like:
- Netflix (ongoing subscription)
- Spotify (continuous value)
- Dropbox (storage subscription)
