## Key Decision Points

### Do you want to:

1. **Charge for the service?** 
   - Yes → Subscription model (recommended)
   - No → Ad-supported or free

2. **Handle payments?**
   - Yes → Stripe (automated, easy)
   - No → Free service only

3. **Support SMS?**
   - Yes → Add £2/month, use Twilio
   - No → Email only (simpler)

4. **Build mobile app?**
   - Yes → Later (Phase 2)
   - No → Web-only (simpler)

5. **Manage users manually?**
   - No → Self-service (recommended)
   - Yes → More work

## Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP):** 
- Basic + Premium plans only
- Email notifications only
- Web dashboard only
- Self-service signup
- Automated everything

**Phase 2 (Growth):**
- Add SMS notifications

- Add advanced features

## Questions to Consider

1. **Target Market:** Learners only or instructors too?
2. **Geographic Scope:** UK only or expand later?
3. **Pricing:** Match competitors or undercut?
4. **Features:** Match competitors or exceed?
5. **Support:** Email only or live chat?

## My Recommendations

✅ **Start Simple:** Basic + Premium plans, email only
✅ **Automate Everything:** Minimal manual work
✅ **Launch Fast:** 6-8 weeks to MVP
✅ **Iterate:** Add features based on user feedback
✅ **Scale Gradually:** Don't over-build initially

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**

- Minimal time investment (2 hours/month maintenance)
- Easy to shut down if needed

**High Reward:**
- Recurring revenue (£1,500+/month potential)
- Scalable (no limit on users)
- Passive income (automated)
- Sellable asset (if successful)

## Success Criteria
